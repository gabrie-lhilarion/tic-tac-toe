## TIC TAC TOE
* This is a practical project to create a tic tac toe game using ruby and the object oriented concept.

## TIC TAC TOE GAME DESCRIPTION
 * Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

    run => git clone https://github.com/gabrie-lhilarion/tic-tac-toe.git

* Playing the game  
   * To play the game two players need to provide their names, then the computer would assign each person a leter either X or O.
